After completing the initial seemingly random set of pulling data from the supplied data set i was tasked with determining some inforation on a different set column of the data. 
I used the coffeehouse coupon type in the data set for my exploration and set out to determine if there was any correlation between the ages of people who said yes to coffee house coupons
as well as their marital status and frequency of visits.

From this initial analysis of the data i found that approximately %50 of people used their coffee house coupons, i also found that the distribution of indvidual in the sample was normal around the age of 26,
it also appears that the percentage of individuals who said yes to the coupons had a higer success rate as their frequency of coffee house visits increased, the caveat here being that these indvidual represented a smaller number than
the number of indvidual who visited the coffee houses between 1-3 times a month, though potentially the monetarry gain would be enough if the indiviuals always used the coupons and visited frequently enough to overcome the smaller 
sample size as that found for the other groups.

Further observing the data i could find no visible trend between marital status of individuals and their tendency to use the coffeehouse coupons, it appears some groups are under represented, 
especially the widowed betwenn the ages of 20-36 as seen in the graphs though this had no impact on the outcome and was just an interesting thing to note as it correlates well to what i understand
life expectancies to look like which shows that this data does mimc normal human trends, and i would expect to find similar trends between ages and income, children etc. though the correlations of these and the 
tendency to say yes to coffee coupons was not investigated here as it would prove redundant with minimal changes to the applied code.
